# Gulpr
This is a simple, lightweight prototyping environment that I use for building single-page apps.

## Features

- **Handlebars**
- **SCSS**
- **Vanilla JS**
- **npm**
- **Gulp**

## Setup
1. ```npm install``` to get all the required dependencies.
2. ```gulp``` boots up the server and begins watching and precompiling assets.
